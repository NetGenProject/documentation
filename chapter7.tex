Creation of sensing machines working in the environment necessitate 
a validation of in the context of physical scenarios. Some of these 
scenario are flooding, insect clouds, pollutions, fires.

The focus of this chapter are tools and methods allowing to produce inputs
for physical  simulations. These simulations are compute intensive. It is expected
that they could be achieved using discrete computation models such as
cellular automata. It is expected that they will cooperate with network simulations
in various ways: production of stimuli on sensors, or dangers for the sensor network
itself.
