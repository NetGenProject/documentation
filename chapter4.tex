Be fore developing actual programs for wireless sensor networks, it
is good to check if the cooperation of local programs will lead
to working and efficient results.

The distributed behaviour comes from:

\begin{itemize}
\item an architecture specification, such as {\tt mekong1.occ},
\item a behaviour executed by nodes, such as {\tt nodes-test-include.occ}.
\end{itemize}

The two descriptions are orthogonal, meaning that one can make
evolution on the architecture at fixed behaviour, or make evolutions on
the behaviour with fixed architecture. The situation is well known
in computer architecture. It is named an Y methodological approach,
and was popularized by Gajski.
The bottom branch carrying measures produced from tools (energy, 
response time, cost, etc\ldots).
