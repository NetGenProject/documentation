\chapter{Physical modelling}

Combining physical simulation and sensor network simulation allows to verify
the accurracy of the sensing process in relation with the physical process.
In most of the cases, the two activities are independent, but there are known situations
where a control loop exist.

This chapter will shortly discuss preliminary works where geographic data are
extracted (see chapter \ref{sec:chapter5}), analyzed, and processed to simulate the
the physical process:
\begin{enumerate}
\item case of a mobile moving inside a set of sensors,
\item case of cellular automata representing physical process.
\end{enumerate}


In these situations the physical process spread over 2D or 3D spaces, that are
divided into a number of adjacent cells. One solution to keep track of evolutions 
is to use massive parallelism with a good computation candidate being cellular automata.
