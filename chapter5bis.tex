This chapter will present QuickMap, an evolution of the tool presented in chapter \ref{sec:chapter5}
to support precise geographic positions and easy map  browsing. 

A movie is available at {\tt http://wsn.univ-brest.fr/QuickMap/} that demonstrates 
the tool in action to describe and control field of sensors,  working
under the control of satellite.

QuickMap has also support for displaying 
buildings or obstacles representations extracted from OpenStreetMap databases. 
The present tools allow to interact with the more common public information systems 
such as Google map and OpenStreetMap. 

The map browser is a tool allowing to display various kind of maps and to represent 
locations of interest such as sensors set in the country. 
As this tool is developped on the same platform as NetGen, the procedures described 
in chapter \ref{sec:chapter1} will apply to access the software: 
\begin{itemize}
\item start a fresh image and ensure that the NetGen package is loaded with one of the last version (1.28.1.2.5 should work)
\item open the store dialog from VisualWorks main window menu bar
\item select QuickMap package 
\item select last version, and type load from the pop-up menu
\end{itemize}

the hand cursor. The sensor wheel controls depth in the map system, here OpenStreetMap.}
